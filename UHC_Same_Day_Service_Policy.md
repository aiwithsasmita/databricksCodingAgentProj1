## Policy Overview

The Same Day/Same Service Policy addresses those instances when a single code should be reported by a physician(s) or Other Qualified Healthcare Professional(s) for multiple Evaluation and Management (E/M) services for a patient on a single date of service.

**General Rule:** A single E/M code should be used to report all E/M services provided for a patient on each given day. Prolonged services and care plan oversight may be exceptions. (See UnitedHealthcare's Prolonged Services and Care Plan Oversight policies for more information.)

---

## Reimbursement Guidelines

### Medicare Claims Processing Manual Guidance

> "Physicians in the same group practice who are in the same specialty must bill and be paid as though they were a single physician. If more than one evaluation and management (face-to-face) service is provided on the same day to the same patient by the same physician or more than one physician in the same specialty in the same group, only one evaluation and management service may be reported unless the evaluation and management services are for unrelated problems. Instead of billing separately, the physicians should select a level of service representative of the combined visits and submit the appropriate code for that level."

> "Contractors pay a physician for only one hospital visit per day for the same patient, whether the problems seen during the encounters are related or not. The inpatient hospital visit descriptors contain the phrase 'per day' which means that the code and the payment established for the code represent all services provided on that date. The physician should select a code that reflects all services provided during the date of the service."

> "In a hospital inpatient situation involving one physician covering for another, if physician A sees the patient in the morning and physician B, who is covering for A, sees the same patient in the evening, contractors do not pay physician B for the second visit. The hospital visit descriptors include the phrase 'per day' meaning care for the day."

> "If the physicians are each responsible for a different aspect of the patient's care, pay both visits if the physicians are in different specialties and the visits are billed with different diagnoses."

### National Correct Coding Initiative Policy Manual Guidance

> "Procedures should be reported with the most comprehensive CPT code that describes the services performed. Physicians must not unbundle the services described by a HCPCS/CPT code."

> "A physician should not report multiple HCPCS/CPT codes when a single comprehensive HCPCS/CPT code describes these services."

### UnitedHealthcare's Application

Consistent with Medicare, UnitedHealthcare's Same Day/Same Service policy recognizes physicians or Other Qualified Healthcare Professionals of the same group and specialty as the same physician; **physician subspecialty is not considered**.

According to correct coding methodology, physicians are to select the code that accurately identifies the service(s) performed. Multiple E/M services, when reported on the same date for the same patient by the Same Specialty Physician or Other Qualified Health Care Professional, will be subject to edits used by and sourced to third party authorities.

---

## Edit Sources

UnitedHealthcare sources its Same Day Same Service edits to methodologies used and recognized by third party authorities. Those methodologies can be:
- **Definitive:** Based on very specific instructions from the given source
- **Interpreted:** Based on an interpretation of instructions from the identified source

### Sources Used:
1. Current Procedural Terminology book (CPT®) from the American Medical Association (AMA)
2. CMS National Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) edits
3. CMS Policy
4. Physician specialty societies (e.g., American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American College of Cardiology, and Society of Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology)

## Edit Types

The following are edit types that may be applied for E/M services in the Same Day Same Service Policy:

### CCI Definitive
An edit sourced to specific billing guidelines from the General Correct Coding Policies contained in the National Correct Coding Policy Manual published by CMS.

**Example:** The Evaluation and Management Services section (chapter xi) specifically states "A physician should not report an 'initial' per diem E&M service with the same type of 'subsequent' per diem service on the same date of service." UnitedHealthcare will not separately reimburse for an initial and a subsequent per diem service on the same date, such as 99223 and 99232.

### CMS Definitive
The CMS Program Memorandum (cms.hhs.gov), Transmittal No. AB-02-158, Nov. 8, 2002, gives clarification of billing requirements for code G0247. It states: "G0247 must be submitted on the same claim with the same date of service as either G0245 or G0246 in order to be considered for payment"; therefore, the codes G0245 and G0246 are listed as principal procedures for code G0247.

### Modifier 25 Usage
UnitedHealthcare will allow modifier 25 to indicate a significant and separately identifiable E/M service when a second physician in the same group and specialty provides a separate E/M service on the same day for an unrelated problem.

**When Modifier 25 is NOT appropriate:**
- Reporting two E/M services where one is a "per day" code
- Reporting separate services when a more comprehensive code exists that describes the services

## Questions and Answers

### Q1: Office Visit and Hospital Admission on Different Dates
**Q:** If a patient is seen in the office at 3:00 p.m. and admitted to the hospital at 1:00 a.m. the next day, may both the office visit and the initial hospital care be reported?

**A:** Yes. Because different dates are involved, both codes may be reported. The CPT states services on the same date must be rolled up into the initial hospital care code. The term "same date" does not mean a 24-hour period. Refer to the CPT book for more information.

---

### Q2: Hospital Visit and Discharge Management on Same Day
**Q:** May a physician report both a hospital visit and hospital discharge day management service on the same day?

**A:** No. The hospital visit descriptors include the phrase "per day" meaning they include all care for a day. Codes 99238-99239 (hospital discharge day management services) are used to report services on the final day of the hospital stay. To report both the hospital visit code and the hospital discharge day management services code would be duplicative.

---

### Q3: Same-Day Admission and Discharge
**Q:** If a patient is admitted as an inpatient and discharged on the same day, may the hospital discharge day management code be reported?

**A:** No. To report services for a patient who is admitted as an inpatient and discharged on the same day, use only the appropriate code for Observation or Inpatient Care Services (Including Admission and Discharge Services) as described by CPT codes 99234-99236.

---

### Q4: Multiple Hospital Visits for Unrelated Problems
**Q:** May a physician or separate physicians of the same group and specialty report multiple hospital visits on the same day for the same patient for unrelated problems?

**A:** No. The inpatient hospital visit descriptors contain the phrase "per day" which means that the code and the payment established for the code represent all services provided on that date. The physician/s should select a single code that reflects all services provided during the date of the service.

---

### Q5: Covering Physician Scenario
**Q:** In a hospital inpatient situation involving one physician covering for another, if physician A sees the patient in the morning and physician B, who is covering for A, sees the same patient in the evening, will UnitedHealthcare pay physician B for the second visit?

**A:** No. The inpatient hospital visit descriptors contain the phrase "per day" which means that the code and the payment established for the code represent all services provided on that date. The physicians should select a single code that reflects all services provided during the date of the service.

---

### Q6: ER to Hospital Admission
**Q:** If a physician sees his patient in the emergency room and decides to admit the person to the hospital, should both services (the emergency department visit and the initial hospital visit) be reported?

**A:** No. When the patient is admitted to the hospital via another site of service (e.g., hospital emergency department, physician's office, nursing facility), all services provided by the physician in conjunction with that admission are considered part of the initial hospital care when performed on the same date as the admission.

---

### Q7: Different Specialty Physicians in Same Group
**Q:** If a patient is seen for more than one E/M service on a single date of service, and each service is performed by a physician with a different specialty designation, but in the same group practice, would each E/M service be separately reimbursable?

**A:** Yes, in certain circumstances. An E/M service provided on the same date by different physicians who are in a group practice but who have different specialty designations may be separately reimbursable. The Same Day/Same Service policy applies when multiple E/M services are reported by physicians in the same group and specialty on the same date of service. In that case, only one E/M is separately reimbursable, unless the second service is for an unrelated problem and reported with modifier 25. This would not apply when one of the E/M services is a "per day" code.

---

### Q8: Same Specialty but Different Subspecialty
**Q:** If a patient is seen for more than one E/M service on a single date of service, and each service is performed by a physician of the same group and specialty but with a different subspecialty designation, would each E/M service be separately reimbursable?

**A:** No. Subspecialty is not considered when applying this reimbursement policy.

---

### Q9: Physician and Qualified Healthcare Professional Same Specialty
**Q:** If a physician and a Qualified Healthcare Professional from the same group with the same specialty (as identified by their related taxonomy codes) both provided per day E/M services to the same patient on a single date of service, would each E/M service be separately reimbursable?

**A:** No. Same specialty under the same group practice allows only one E/M service to be eligible for reimbursement. The physician and Qualified Healthcare Professional should select a single code reflecting all services provided during the service date.

---

### Q10: Same Individual Provider Multiple Per Day Services
**Q:** If a patient is seen for more than one per day E/M service on a single date of service, and each service is performed by the Same Individual Physician or Other Qualified Healthcare Professional, would each E/M be separately reimbursable?

**A:** No. The inpatient hospital E/M code descriptions contain the phrase "per day" which means that the code and the payment established for the code represent all services provided on that date by the Same Individual Physician or Other Qualified Healthcare Professional. The physician or Other Qualified Healthcare Professional should select a single code reflecting all services provided during the service date.
