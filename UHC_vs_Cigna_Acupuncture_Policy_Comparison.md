## 9. Conclusion

UnitedHealthcare's current Acupuncture Policy (2025R6006A) focuses primarily on billing/reimbursement rules (unit limits, bundling, code restrictions) but lacks the clinical governance framework that Cigna employs. This creates significant financial exposure and exploitation vulnerabilities.

**Key Findings:**
1. UHC has **no diagnosis restrictions** - any condition can be treated
2. UHC has **no medical necessity criteria** - no clinical justification required
3. UHC has **no outcome accountability** - treatment continues regardless of results
4. UHC has **no maintenance exclusion** - indefinite wellness treatment is covered
5. UHC's **billing rules are stronger** than Cigna's (MFD, bundling, E/M)

**Recommended Approach:**
Adopt Cigna's medical necessity framework while retaining UHC's superior billing/reimbursement controls. This hybrid approach would create the most comprehensive acupuncture policy in the market.

**Estimated Impact:**
- $57-100M annual savings from appropriate denials
- 10-12% increase in medical necessity denial rate
- Reduced exploitation vulnerability
- Alignment with evidence-based medicine standards
