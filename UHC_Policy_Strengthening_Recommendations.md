# SECTION 1: UHC Existing Rules vs Competitor Analysis

## 1.1 UHC Denial Rules Comparison

### UHC DR-001: Maximum Frequency Per Day (MFD) Exceeded

**UHC Current Policy:**
> *"In accordance with the code descriptions and/or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines and National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) established Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE) values, the maximum units of Acupuncture services allowed per date of service are as follows: 97810: 1, 97811: 2, 97813: 1, 97814: 2, S8930: 3"*

---

### UHC DR-005: Invalid E/M Service

**UHC Current Policy:**
> *"Per CPT guidelines an evaluation and management (E/M) service may only be reported in addition to Acupuncture services if the patient's condition requires a significant, separately identifiable E/M service above and beyond the usual pre-service and post-service work associated with the Acupuncture service."*
> 
> *"The initial Acupuncture service codes include E/M components such as the assessment provided prior to and after the needle insertion, treatment discussion and recommendations, preparation, documentation and home instruction."*
> — [UHC Policy 2025R6006A](https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-reimbursement/COMM-Acupuncture-Policy.pdf)

---

### UHC DR-006: Non-Face-to-Face Time

**UHC Current Policy:**
> *"This policy enforces the code description for Acupuncture services which are to be reported based on 15 minute time increments of personal face-to-face contact with the patient and not the duration of the needle(s) placement."*
>
> *"Acupuncture code selection is based on the service provided in 15 minute increments. The time calculation is determined using face-to-face patient contact only. It would not be appropriate to count time spent away from the patient as part of the code selection and units submitted."*
> — [UHC Policy 2025R6006A](https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-reimbursement/COMM-Acupuncture-Policy.pdf)

## 1.2 UHC Exploitation Tactics Comparison

### UHC ET-001: Date Splitting / Service Fragmentation

**UHC Current Detection:**
- Same patient, same provider on consecutive dates
- Units exactly at MFD each day
- > 3 visits per week same patient
- > 12 acupuncture visits per month

**Cigna Approach:**
> *"Continuation of treatment is contingent upon progression towards defined treatment goals and evidenced by specific significant objective functional improvements (outcome assessment scales, range of motion)."*
> — [Cigna CPG 024](https://static.cigna.com/assets/chcp/pdf/coveragePolicies/medical/cpg024_acupuncture.pdf)

**Aetna Approach:**
> *"If no clinical benefit is appreciated after four weeks of acupuncture, then the treatment plan should be reevaluated. Further acupuncture treatment is not considered medically necessary if the member does not demonstrate meaningful improvement in symptoms."*
> — [Aetna CPB 0135](https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/100_199/0135.html)

**Assessment**: ⚠️ **ADOPT FROM COMPETITORS**

| Recommendation | Source | Priority |
|----------------|--------|----------|
| Add 4-week reassessment requirement | Aetna | **CRITICAL** |
| Require documented progress for continuation | Cigna | **CRITICAL** |
| Define "meaningful improvement" criteria | Aetna | **HIGH** |

**Proposed Policy Language (Adopt from Aetna):**
> "If no clinical benefit is appreciated after four weeks of acupuncture, then the treatment plan should be reevaluated. Further acupuncture treatment is not considered medically necessary if the member does not demonstrate meaningful improvement in symptoms."

## 2.4 NEW Exploitation Tactics to Add (From Competitors)

### 2.4.1 Diagnosis Code Manipulation Detection

**Source - Cigna ET-001:**
> *"Provider assigns covered diagnosis code (e.g., musculoskeletal pain) when actual treatment is for non-covered condition (e.g., infertility, wellness)"*
> — Cigna Analysis

**Source - Aetna ET-001:**
> *"Provider assigns covered diagnosis (e.g., chronic neck pain M54.2) when treating experimental condition (e.g., fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel)"*
> — Aetna Analysis

**UHC Implementation Required:**

| Audit Flag | Detection Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| DX-MANIP-001 | Same diagnosis code for >95% of provider's patients |
| DX-MANIP-002 | Documentation mentions excluded conditions |
| DX-MANIP-003 | Prior claims history for excluded conditions |
| DX-MANIP-004 | Treatment points inconsistent with billed diagnosis |

---

### 2.4.2 Perpetual Treatment Detection (Enhanced)

**Source - Cigna ET-004:**
> *"Provider continues treatment indefinitely by documenting minimal progress to avoid maintenance classification"*
>
> *Detection: > 12 weeks without significant documented improvement, > 20 visits for same condition, FOM scores showing < MCID improvement"*
> — Cigna Analysis

**Source - Aetna ET-003:**
> *"Provider continues treatment indefinitely by documenting minimal 'improvement' to avoid maintenance classification"*
>
> *Detection: > 8 weeks without significant documented improvement, same findings visit after visit"*
> — Aetna Analysis

**UHC Implementation Required:**

| Audit Flag | Detection Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| PERP-TREAT-001 | > 12 visits for same diagnosis without improvement documentation |
| PERP-TREAT-002 | Treatment > 90 days same condition |
| PERP-TREAT-003 | No discharge plan documented |
| PERP-TREAT-004 | Identical clinical findings across 4+ consecutive visits |

---

### 2.4.3 Diagnosis Creep/Rotation Detection

**Source - Cigna ET-007:**
> *"When maximum benefit reached for one diagnosis, provider switches to new covered diagnosis to restart treatment"*
>
> *Detection: New diagnosis every 8-12 weeks, patient with 3+ different covered diagnoses in 12 months"*
> — Cigna Analysis

**Source - Aetna ET-006:**
> *"When one covered diagnosis reaches 4-week no-benefit threshold, provider switches to different covered diagnosis"*
>
> *Detection: Patient with 3+ different covered diagnoses in 6 months, rotating through neck → back → headache → TMD"*
> — Aetna Analysis

**UHC Implementation Required:**

| Audit Flag | Detection Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| DX-CREEP-001 | 3+ different diagnoses for same patient in 6 months |
| DX-CREEP-002 | Diagnosis change within 7 days of prior diagnosis plateau |
| DX-CREEP-003 | Sequential pattern: one diagnosis ends, another begins same week |
| DX-CREEP-004 | Rotating through specific diagnosis sequence |

### 2.4.4 Wellness Disguised as Treatment Detection

**Source - Cigna ET-009:**
> *"Provider bills ongoing wellness/maintenance acupuncture as medically necessary treatment"*
>
> *Detection: Regular interval visits (weekly, bi-weekly) indefinitely, documentation language like 'wellness,' 'stress reduction,' 'preventive,' no functional deficit documented"*
> — Cigna Analysis

**UHC Implementation Required:**

| Audit Flag | Detection Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| WELLNESS-001 | Treatment > 12 months same condition with stable status |
| WELLNESS-002 | Documentation includes "wellness," "stress," "relaxation" |
| WELLNESS-003 | No functional deficit ever documented |
| WELLNESS-004 | Fixed interval visits (exact weekly/bi-weekly) indefinitely |
